\begin{homeworkProblem}



The boundary conditions are expressed in terms of potentials. Thus, I should use Laplace's equation and the Legendre polynomials to determine the potential everywhere between the two spheres. Due to the azimuthal symmetry of the problem I can assume that ``$m = 0$'' for my associated Legendre polynomials.

\[
\Phi(r,\theta) = \sum\limits_{l = 0}^{\infty} \left( A_l r^l + B_l r^{-(l+1)} P_l(\cos\theta) \right)
\]

Using orthogonality of the Legendre polynomials we can solve for $A_l$ and $B_l$. We have two boundary conditions. At $r = a$ $\Phi = V$ and at $r = b$ $\Phi = V$. This sets up the two equations (note that $\int\limits_0^\pi P_l(\cos \theta)P_m(\cos \theta) d\cos\theta = \frac{2}{l + 1} \delta_{l m}$).
