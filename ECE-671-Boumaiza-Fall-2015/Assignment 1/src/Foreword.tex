\section*{Foreword}

This problem set had me using a few tools at different times. I used Keysight's
Advanced Design Suite (ADS) at a few points during my homework, for simulations.
I have also used Mathematica, extensively, to assist me with algebra and
plugging in values. Each problem is more or less self-contained in the written
text. However, if you want to see calculations or simulations of anything that
is referenced in the problem please consult the appendix for the associated
problem. I have almost as many appendices as problems to account for this extra
information. Please don't hesitate to ask me any questions you may have
concerning my work. I have done my best to make it clear, but sometimes clear is
only ``clear'' to one's self.
