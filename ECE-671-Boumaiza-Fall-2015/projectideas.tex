\section*{Final Project Ideas}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Design of broadband matching network using SRFT
    \item Multiband filter (dual, triband)
    \item Reconfigurable bandpass filter
    \item Design of matching networks using filter theory
    \item Compact broadband hybrid couplers
    \item Broadband Wilkinson Power Divider
    \item TRL Calibration Technique for On-Wafer Measurement
\end{enumerate}

Try to use transaction papers not conference papers. It is hard to re-do
conference paper work. It is acceptable to try and reproduce someone's
work. Read a paper and try to do it yourself. APT, MWCL, TCAS
(transaction components).
