\section{Proposal}
\label{sec:proposal}

Our lab (Digital Quantum Matter Laboratory) uses a dilution refrigerator to
perform cryogenic circuit measurements. These refrigerators use multiple
temperature stages which are thermally anchored to different temperatures. The
coaxial cabling that we use to interface with the electronics in the dilution
refrigerator is constructed using a series of coaxial cable segments anchored to
each stage, sequentially. These cables are anchored to attenuators at each stage
and transmit thermal noise to the lowest temperature stage (which is cooled to $
\approx 10$~mK). My goal is to construct a model for the noise induced at the
mixing chamber stage by the coaxial cabling. I will use the heat diffusion
equation, knowing the material properties of the cables, and the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem (Johnson-Nyquist noise) to determine the amount
of thermal noise present at the mixing chamber stage. A rough outline for my
project will be to:
\begin{enumerate}
   \item Determine the temperature gradient of each cable at each stage of the
      fridge.
   \item Discretize the cable into many series resistors.
   \item Determine the amount of noise generate by the series connections of
      resistors.
   \item Time/Knowledge allowing: Determine how the thermal noise interacts with
      and affects a two-level quantum system (qubit).
\end{enumerate}
