\begin{homeworkProblem}
    The Michelson visibility of a source, as a function of the delay $ \tau $
    has been expressed as
    \[
        V(\tau) =
        \frac{I_{\textrm{max}}(\tau) -
        I_{\textrm{min}}(\tau)}{I_{\textrm{max}}(\tau) + I_{\textrm{min}}(\tau)}
        \enskip.
    \]
    Now, this expression is not a good expression. We will demonstrate why in
    this problem and offer a superior expression at the end. The visibility
    attempts to quantify the degree of variation in the signal intensity as the
    delay changes over small values of $ \tau $. In most experiments with
    Michelson interferometry, Increasing the delay by large amounts tends to, on
    average, reduce the intensity. However, increasing the delay by small
    amounts has the potential to swing the intensity by much larger amounts than
    would happen (on the average) with large increases in the delay. In other
    words. $ V(\tau) $ tends to have a quickly oscillating function of $ \tau $
    and a slow decaying function of $ \tau $. When describing the visibility we
    are interested in the variation of the oscillatory function according to the
    slow envelope which guides its decay. In order to get our hands on these
    envelope and oscillatory functions we should calculated $ I(\tau) $, the
    intensity as a function of delay.

    \begin{align}
        I(\tau) &= \epsilon_{0} c |t r|^2 E_{0}^{2} \left( 1 + \Re(g^{(1)}(\tau) \right)
    \end{align}
    We are interested in a source which has been Doppler-broadened. The
    first-order coherence of this source is given in Eq.~4.34 of the course
    notes and is
    \[
        g^{(1)}(\tau) = e^{-i \omega_{0} \tau - \frac{1}{2}\tau^{2} \sigma^{2}}
        \enskip.
    \]
    Thus, $ I(\tau) = \epsilon_{0} c |t r|^2 E_{0}^{2} \left( 1 +
    e^{-\frac{1}{2}\tau^2 \sigma^2}\cos(\omega_{0}\tau) \right) $. Now, $
    \sigma^{2} = \omega_{0}^{2} \frac{k T}{m c^2} $. Assuming a room-temperature
    source (\SI{25}{\celsius}), a HeNe gas laser (weighted mass of $ \approx
    \SI{1.07e-26}{\kilo\gram} $, wavelength of \SI{632.8}{\nano\meter}), and $
    \epsilon_{0} c |tr|^2 E_{0}^2 = 1 $ we can plot the visibility of this
    source as a function of delay.

    \begin{figure}[ht]

        \caption{Intensity as a function of delay time (x axis normalized to $
            \omega_0 \approx \SI{2.98}{\tera\radian\per\second}) (f_0 \approx
        \SI{474}{\tera\hertz})$.}
        \label{fig:Figure1a}
    \end{figure}

    Quite clearly, the visibility appears to be 1 for very small $ \tau $ (since
    the maximum value is close to 2 and the minimum value is close to 0).
    However, there should be a Gaussian envelope guiding the intensity function.
    This is not visible because of the time scale of this decay.

    In order for a detector to be able to reproduce the theoretical expectation
    of $ I(\tau) $ a detector would need to be able to measure/average the
    intensity over an average of $ \approx \SI{.1}{\femto\second} $. This is
    entirely impractical given the bandwidth/response times of contemporary
    photodiodes (e.g. Thorlabs FDS100 has a \SI{35}{\pico\second} rise time). In
    fact, it would be nearly impossible for the detector to average the measured
    intensity over any length of time that is significant relative to $ \omega_0
    $.

    Now, we want to quantify how the local extrema (maxima and minima) vary as a
    function of $ \tau $. Since the oscillations jjkk at such a short time
    scale relative to the envelope, we can consider the oscillations of any one
    period as being of fixed amplitude. Then, we can take the maximum as the
    maximum of the $\cos$ function in $ 1 + e^{-\frac{1}{2}\tau^2
    \sigma^2}\cos(\omega_{0}\tau) $. The minimum, correspondingly, can be given
    by $ 1 - e^{-\frac{1}{2}\tau^2 \sigma^2} $. Thus, the visibility, according
    to the above expression would be
    \[
        V(\tau) = \frac{\left( 1 + e^{-\frac{1}{2}\tau^2 \sigma^2}\right) -
        \left( 1 - e^{-\frac{1}{2}\tau^2 \sigma^2}\right)}
        {\left( 1 + e^{-\frac{1}{2}\tau^2 \sigma^2}\right) + \left( 1 -
        e^{-\frac{1}{2}\tau^2 \sigma^2}\right)}
        =
        \frac{2 e^{-\frac{1}{2}\tau^2 \sigma^2}}{2}
        =
        e^{-\frac{1}{2}\tau^2 \sigma^2}
    \]
    Note that by using the positive envelope and the negative envelope and
    the average of $ I(\tau) $ we can write the visibility, for this case,
    equivalently as
    \[
        V(\tau) = (I_{\textrm{+env}}(\tau) - I_{\textrm{-env}}(\tau)) /
        2 \overline{I} \enskip,
    \]
    where $ I_{\textrm{+/-env}} $ is the positive/negative envelope function of
    the intensity and $ \overline{I} $ is the mean of $ I(\tau) $ over all $
    \tau $. Calculating the visibility trivially reproduces the same result as
    the first expression. In fact, if the visibility function is symmetric about
    the mean, then the positive envelope will be related to the negative
    envelope: $ I_{\textrm{-env}} = 2 \overline{I} - I_{\textrm{+env}} $. Thus,
    the visibility function can, once again, be rewritten as
    \[
        V(\tau) = (2 I_{\textrm{+env}}(\tau) - 2 \overline{I}) /
        (2 \overline{I})
        = \frac{I_{\textrm{+env}}(\tau)}{\overline{I}} - 1
    \]

    The advantage of an expression like this one is two-fold: 1) Most intensity
    correlations ($ I(\tau) $) will be symmetric about the mean and 2) it's
    practically measurable. A plot of the two envelopes of the intensity
    functions and the mean is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Figure1b}.
