The critical angle is the angle at which $\sin(\theta_2)= \pi/2$ in Snell's law - $n_1 \sin\theta_1 = n_2\sin\theta_2$. If $n_1$ is air (which its claimed to be in this problem) then the critical incidence angle is related to the incident angle $\theta_I$ through $\sin\theta_I = n_2$. Since $\theta_I \approx \pi/2$ $\sin\theta_I = \sin(\pi/2-\phi_I) = \cos(\phi_I)$. Now, $\phi_I$ is pretty small according to the problem statement. Thus, $1+\phi_I^2/2 \approx n_2 = 1-\delta$ and, trivially, $\sqrt{2\delta}\approx \phi_I$.
