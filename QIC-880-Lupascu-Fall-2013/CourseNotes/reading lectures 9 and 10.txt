  abstract = {We present a multilevel quantum theory of decoherence for a general
	circuit realization of a superconducting qubit. Using electrical
	network graph theory, we derive a Hamiltonian for the circuit. The
	dissipative circuit elements (external impedances, shunt resistors)
	are described using the Caldeira-Leggett model. The master equation
	for the superconducting phases in the Born-Markov approximation is
	derived and brought into the Bloch-Redfield form in order to describe
	multilevel dissipative quantum dynamics of the circuit. The model
	takes into account leakage effects, i.e., transitions from the allowed
	qubit states to higher excited states of the system. As a special
	case, we truncate the Hilbert space and derive a two-level (Bloch)
	theory with characteristic relaxation (T-1) and decoherence (T-2)
	times. We apply our theory to the class of superconducting flux qubits;
	however, the formalism can be applied for both superconducting flux
	and charge qubits. }}
