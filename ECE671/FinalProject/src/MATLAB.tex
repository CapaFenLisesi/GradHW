\section{MATLAB\textsuperscript{\textregistered} Code}
\label{sec:appendix_a_matlabtextregistered}

Below, I have included all of the source code necessary to replicate my results.
The code base is open to many revisions (as discussed in the report). I plan on
making this SRFT project open to the public on Github. This way, SRFT design can
be open to the public.

Nota bene: The code is well-documented. However, there are many blocks that are
commented out that were for testing purposes that can still be used for that
purpose. In my opinion, these blocks do not make reading the source inordinately
difficult.

% Main script file.
\subsection{Example9\_2\_1.m}
The below file is the script file which uses all of the other function files
that are included below.
