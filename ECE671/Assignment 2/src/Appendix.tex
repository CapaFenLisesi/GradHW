\subsection{Mathematica Code: Matching}
The code included in the subsection ``Mathematica Code: Matching'' provides the
Mathematica code that was used to generate the ideal match. Note that this ideal
match was not always used. In the case of the high-gain amplifier it was chosen
to reduce the gain from the maximum gain by almost as much as was possible
($\approx \SI{1}{\deci\bel}$) to ensure the lowest noise figure as was possible.
However, the results given are for those of an ideal match. To be clear, a table
is provided at the end of the section that enumerates which length of stub must
be used and what length of line (after the stub) must be used. The length of
line between the load and the stub is immaterial since the line is matched to
the load such that $Z_{in} = Z_l$.
