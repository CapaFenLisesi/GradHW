\section*{Problem 3: Lossy LC matching network}
\addtocounter{section}{1}
\setcounter{equation}{0}
The first thing to do is to find the amount of loss in the matching network.
This loss will be due to two non-ideal conditions for the circuit elements
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The inductor is lossy with series lossy element $R_s$
    \item The capacitor is lossy with parallel lossy element $R_p$
\end{enumerate}

Thus, the loss in $R_s$ can be found by driving the now-matched input network
with a voltage $V_{in}$ and finding the following:

\[ 
        P_{s} = \frac{1}{2} \Re \left( V_{s} I_s^* \right) 
\]

$V_s = V_{in} \frac{R_s}{Z_{in}}$ and $I_s = \frac{V_{in}}{Z_{in}}$ 

The power delivered to the series resistor is now 
\[ 
    P_s = \frac{1}{2} \frac{\left|V_{in}\right|^2 R_s}{\left|Z_{in}\right|^2}
\]

The power delivered to the parallel resistor is a bit more tricky. We can
consider the voltage across the parallel branch (with $R_p$, $R_L$ and $Z_C$).
The voltage across that branch is 

\[ 
        V_p = V_{in} \frac{Z_c||R_L||R_p}{Z_{in}}
\]

The current through $R_p$, $I_p$, is:
\[ 
    I_p = \frac{V_p}{R_p} 
\]

Thus, we can write the power delivered to this resistor as:

\[ 
    P_p = \frac{1}{2}  \frac{\left|V_p \right|^2 }{R_p}
\]

And the total power delivered to these two circuits elements is just

\begin{align}
    P_s + P_p = \frac{1}{2} \frac{\left| V_{in} \right|^2 R_s}{\left| Z_{in}
    \right|^2} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\left| V_{in} \right|^2 \Big|
Z_c||R_L||R_p \Big|^2}{R_p\left| Z_{in} \right|^2}
\end{align}

%TODO: Keep expanding the expression for total loss and express this in terms of
%a ratio n = R_l / R_s. Show that the loss increases as n grows. 

%TODO:To find the insertion loss, calculate the amount of power received by the
%load and subtract that from the power delivered by the source. This is, find
%Z_{in}(f) and calculate V_{source}^2/(Z_{in}) and subtract 
%from V_source^2/{Z_{in}+Z_{source})
